# Hi there.

I am currently an intern at Evolução do Varejo.

I’m working on Darwin — a project developing APIs and integrations using AI as a backbone for it.

I’m learning Go and Python and deepening my skills in SQL databases. Also I've recently started learning about front-end tools and different technologies, specially React and JavaScript.

I’m looking to collaborate on backend projects, APIs, open-source tools, and automation.

I would like to help with scalability, DevOps (Docker/Nginx/CI-CD), using best practices for nonproductive and productive workloads.

How to reach me: via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armcardoso/)

Pronouns: he/him. (Não sei se deixaria isso)

Fun fact: I enjoy challenges, so no matter how complex the problem seems, I will always try to solve it and have a blast while at it.

Tech Stack (eu destacaria quais você tá aprendendo com um asterisco por exemplo)

Languages: Go, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express

Databases: Relational database (MySQL and PostgreSQL)

DevOps: Linux, Apache, Docker (learning)

Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code

## Current Focus
